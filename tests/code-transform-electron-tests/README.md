This was an early experiment in automatic testing of recast code transforms in browser env with electron.

It worked for a while, but is currently broken because of changes in AST code in main app.

I also had some problems with `import` vs `required` but nothing that couldn't be fixed with babel.

I'm leaving it in here for future references.
